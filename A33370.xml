            <title>A paradisical dialogue betwixt faith and reason disputing the high mysterious secrets of eternity, the like never extant in our revelation. As touching God in eternity, how he became time in flesh, and how he dyed in the grave, and ascended to his glory again. Also what the angels are in form and nature, and how the angel became a devil, and that devil man; and that this world was prepared for the devil, so this the devils kingdom; and what the soul is, with the place of its glory and torment. With a brief narration what a commission is, and how many commissions there are; what the difference of their worships, and how that the law was given to the devil; with a brief discourse on the catechism, the Lords Prayer, and the creeds; as also, a divine prospect to the elect of the Lord. Written by Law. Claxton, the onely true bishop and faithful messenger of Christ Jesus, creator of heaven and earth.</title>

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>It was the greateſt ground of all; for if God had not a form of his own, it had been in vain to create either Angel or man, in his form, and that becauſe he created them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his glorious perſon.</p>

And whereas thou ſayeſt, God having a Perſon, cannot fill Heaven and earth with his glory, I ſay, without his Perſon he could fill nothing at all: As for inſtance, what glory can there be in a King without a perſon? whoſe perſon being enthroned in his Crown and Dignity, with all things ſuitable to his Majeſtie, is that which fills his Court and Kingdom with renowned glory; not that the Kings perſon is in every place, but onely in his Court, yet the hearts of his ſubjects over all his Dominions, is filled with the report of his great power and glory: ſo that the ſound thereof, as <hi>Solomons,</hi> doth ring of the glory and greatneſs of his perſon; ſo it is not the perſon of God, but his powerful nature, flowing in the hearts of his people, that ſupports all things created by him; neither is his perſon in any other place but his Kingdom of glory onely.</p>

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:31583:16"/> ſpirits being pure Reaſon, the very nature of them, is to deſire after the knowledge of that incomprehenſible glory which gave them their beings; and I ſay, it is the variety of his Divine Excellencies flowing to their deſiring natures, is that heavenly food that is prepared for their eternal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation; therefore I ſay, the continuance of the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate Angels being expired, the Creator onely withheld the inſpirations of Divine glory from him, and immediately for want of that ſpiritual meat to ſatisfie that deſiring na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, his God like purity became nothing elſe but imaginary impurities of ſecret aſpiring deſires above the Creator; ſo that his former pure Reaſon, was become nothing but a loathſome ſink of unclean reaſoning, concerning the true knowledge of the Creator, whether he were the Creator or no; and inſtead of honouring the Creator for his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable wiſdom, of forming out of a little dead duſt ſuch an innumerable Hoſt of Elect Angels, for his perſonal So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety; I ſay, this Angel at the blind barr of his lying imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, he ſecretly arrains the wiſdom of the infinite God in creation, and condemned it as weakneſs it ſelf, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of his imaginary vviſdom: this Angel being lifted up with the wiſdom of his ſpirit and glory of his perſon, he beheld the Wiſdom and Perſons of all the Elect Angels, as ſimple uncomely creatures, in compariſon of him and his wiſdom, and then beholding himſelf with the Creator, he imagines his perſonal wiſdom more capable of a Divine Throne, than he that ſate thereon; alſo he began to imagine a new creation of his own ſuppoſing, as if he had been the Creator he could have formed more glorious creatures than the Angels without duſt or any other matter, or if he muſt have matter to form things wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>hall, he imagined by his word ſpeaking, or thinking, he could have created as many ſpirits without bodies as he ſaw fit; or if he ſaw good, he could have transformed their ſpiritual bodies into any other nature or form after he had created them, and not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in one nature and form alwayes, for he thought it
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:31583:17"/> want of wiſdom and power in the Creator, that the bodies of the Angels might not be tranſmuted into any condition at the pleaſure of him that formed them; therefore in the midſt of theſe and ſuch like his irrational wiſdom of imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary impoſſibilities ſo elevated his out-caſt ſpirit, that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly he utterly abhorred that the Creator or any other creatures ſhould remain in being, unleſs he onely might bear rule over them all.</p>
                  <p>So that when the ſecret pride and envy of the Angelical reprobate was at height of unthroning the Creator, or elſe a diſſolution of all, then the glorious Creator revealed his ſpiritual cruelties unto his holy Angels, and anſwerable to that he would have done for a Creators glory in the viſible ſight of his Angels, God condemned him to be caſt out of his perſonal preſence, and Heavenly Throne or Kingdom for everlaſting, and immediately like unto lightning he was thrown down into this periſhing world, where his deſired Kingdom of God-like Government was prepared for him and his lineal Angels, where they are reſerved in everlaſting chains of darkneſs and unbelief, until the Judgement of the great day.</p>

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:31583:20"/> thoſe Divine qualifications in the glorious Creator above all meaſure; for the Soul of man is not without its ſeveral properties, and yet they are all in a Heavenly Harmony, in that the joy of Soul that <hi>Adam</hi> did poſſeſs aroſe in him from one Divine Heavenly voice, called the Spirit of Faith, which was all ſatisfaction in himſelf with his preſent condition, not having the leaſt thought of further happineſs, then what he enjoyed already; thus as the Divine nature of the Eternal Spirit, was variety of infinite ſatisfaction in it ſelf: So likewiſe the Soul of <hi>Adam</hi> being compoſed of the ſame qualifications, was variety of ſatisfaction in it ſelf alſo, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its meaſure.

                  <p>Now though the ſoul of <hi>Adam</hi> through the divine purity of its nature, was immortal and uncapable of any rebellion againſt the glorious ſpirit of its Creator, yet becauſe its body was natural, and had its beginning of this duſt below, his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal ſoul having its being in a piece of clay, was become ſubject through temptation, to be tranſmuted from its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent condition of his created innocency, for this faith knows though the ſoul of <hi>Adam</hi> was of a divine nature, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was a created nature diſtinct to it ſelf, it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Son or Servant, yea ſubject to its divine God; and that through deep temptation he was ſubject to be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmuted into a ſinful condition, through which both ſoul and body, might not onely be ſubject to natural death, but alſo full of fear of eternal death, or caſting out of the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual

                  <p>I conceive if <hi>Adam</hi> had ſuch divine immortal heaven life, breathed into him which thou calls his ſoul, that was of the ſame property and nature of the divine God, he might by that life have withſtood all temptation whatſoever, though it was in a houſe of clay.</p>

                  <p>Again and again, againſt all thy ſeed I affirm, that the ſoul of <hi>Adam</hi> was onely of the divine nature in its creation, yet becauſe it was one eſſence with a body that was taken out of duſt, it was both probable and capable, to be thought into a condition of entering duſt again, and that for theſe enſuing particulars:</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, if the body of <hi>Adam</hi> had been immortal in his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> creation as well as his ſoul, he would not onely have been uncapable of natural generation, but alſo he would have been uncapable of any tranſmutation whatſoever, and where then had been the prerogative power of infinite wiſdom and tranſcendent glory of the Creator ever been ſeen or known by angels or men? And therefore it was <hi>Adam</hi> knew not whether he ſhould ſtand or fall from his preſent ſtate or no, neither did he know what power he was indued withal in his created purity, neither did he know any greater glory, but what then at preſent he enjoyed; ſo that if <hi>Adam</hi> had known that he had power in his own will, to preſerve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his preſent condition, thou mayeſt be ſure if he could have kept himſelf in that bleſſed ſtate, he would never have loſt it, for making uſe of all the power that was in him, to have reſiſted a temptation unto rebellion, in which he knew there was a threatning of a loſs of that created glory he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, as aforeſaid.</p>

                     <hi>on earth, the Spirit, the Water, and the Blood, and theſe three agree in one:</hi> Now as God did conſiſt of three titles, and not three perſons, as thou and thy ſeed vainly immagine; that is to ſay, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt: So from each of theſe iſſued forth a Commiſſion upon this earth; for in the time that he bore the title of Father, <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets was in Commiſſion: Now when that Father became Word, Fleſh, ſo called Son or Chriſt, then the Apoſtles were in Commiſſion; after that both Father and Son became Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, or one entire Spiritual Body, now in Heaven glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, the next after came forth our Commiſſion; ſo that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the titles above, there was to be three Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in this world, ſuitable to the three titles in Heaven.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As unto the nature of a Commiſſion, it is not given in ſilence, but upon record under hand and ſeal, to the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or Meſſengers therein included, with an exact charge to obſerve the Kings pleaſure, according to the tenor and form thereof: Now this Commiſſion being given to thee, doth not concern another; for the names included for that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſage, doth this Commiſſion belong: Now for any other to counterfeit thy Commiſſion, thou haſt power by vertue thereof, to apprehend him for a Traytor againſt the King thy Maſter.</p>
                  <p>Even ſo it is with a Commiſſion from God, which is not given by private whiſperings in the ſoul, as all counterfeits imagine, every motion, whimſey or fancy in the minde,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:31583:38"/> more then ordinary, is a call from God; not knowing, yet daily reading, that all Commiſſions were given by laudable voyce of words, to the hearing of the ear, as to <hi>Moſes, Paul,</hi> and now in this laſt to <hi>John Reeve:</hi> Now then, what are all theſe ſeven Diſpenſations, but by <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Apoſtles, and this Commiſſion, impeached for Traytors againſt Chriſt the Lord of Glory.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And thirdly, the power of a Commiſſion is ſo great, that it commands, yea, ſubjects the ſpirits of all that it hath to deal with: A man in Commiſſion, repreſents the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the great God of Heaven and Earth, that whatever he bindes, impriſons or condemns on earth, is ſo in Heaven; and whoſoever he declares bleſſed or happy here, are ſo in Heaven; ſo that if thou wert not ſtone blinde, thou wouldſt then ſee, that there is no Teacher publique nor private now living, that hath a Commiſſion, but we; and therefore it is we have power overall mens ſpirits, yea, the judge of all ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things, of what ſect or opinion ſoever.</p>

            <p>Now ye the Believers of our Commiſſion take notice, that of which of theſe twelve particulars before quoted, you by my pen finde ſilence, we own as eternal truth; but the reſt that I ſet my pen againſt, was not our words, but Reaſon the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil-lying imagination, by thoſe aforeſaid Quakers; as do but obſerve, and thou mayeſt diſcern how I binde them hand and foot from their ſuppoſed light, yet real darkneſs, as ſeriouſly minde the firſt forged lie.</p>
            <p>3. L. C. ſaid, <hi>He had nothing of God in him, and many other places, nought of God in him.</hi>

            <p>5. L. C. ſaid, <hi>The Devil was the author of this light in the world.</hi>
